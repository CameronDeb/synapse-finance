Synapse Finance

A full-stack financial SaaS platform I built from scratch. Users can track stocks, view real-time quotes, get in-depth market analysis, manage a portfolio, and stay up on financial news all in one place.

This started as a personal project but grew into a real production app that hit 50+ active users. I handled everything end to end, backend, frontend, database, auth, and deployment.

Tech Stack
